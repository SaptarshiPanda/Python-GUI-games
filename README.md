# Python-GUI-games
A repository of simplistic games developed using Tkinter library in Python.


This repository is a collection of three simplistic popular games that are developed using Tkinter library of python.For playing the games, I have also added the .exe verisions of the files. Only for the Hangman game you need to downnload the text file associated as well. You can customize your Hangman game by adding new words and hints in the text file in the correct format as shown. The games are easy to play and the rules are shortly described prior to the tart of the games.

Happy coding!
